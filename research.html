        <p>My research advances human-centered software engineering by uncovering the behaviors of 
          problem-solving professionals and inventing intelligent, inclusive solutions at the intersection 
          of software engineering (SE), human-computer interaction (HCI), and artificial intelligence (AI). 
          I study how diverse individuals—including professional software engineers, end-user programmers, 
          novices, and those from historically underrepresented groups—engage in solo, team-based, and 
          human–AI programming contexts, including remote and technology-mediated collaboration. Through a 
          rigorous, iterative process grounded in empirical inquiry, theory-building, and systematic evaluation, 
          I produce novel strategies, frameworks, algorithms, visualizations, and tools that bridge human intent 
          with machine execution—expanding the boundaries of inclusive, experience-centered software engineering.

    What if your coding partner were an intelligent, supportive agent—always available, never judgmental, and trained to collaborate like a real teammate? Since 2018, our research has been exploring this future through PairBuddy, a conversational agent designed to bring the benefits of pair programming to everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the time, no conversational agents supported software development—even though programming is inherently collaborative and communicative. Motivated by this gap, we launched one of the earliest efforts to explore inclusive AI-driven pair programming, with support from an <font color="red"><b>NSF CAREER Award</b></font>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Built at the intersection of HCI, AI, education, and cognitive science, PairBuddy is more than just a code assistant. It is designed to support programmers through both technical assistance and social collaboration—fostering confidence, engagement, and equitable learning experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Guided by inclusive design principles and refined through real-world studies, our work aims to shape the next generation of intelligent, collaborative tools for software development. We're also building open datasets, agent prototypes, and educational resources to support the broader research and teaching community.

  <p>
    Just as ants leave pheromone trails and honeybees perform waggle dances to guide others, developers also leave behind behavioral traces—commit logs, navigation paths, and web searches—that can be harnessed to support others working on similar tasks. This research explores how these digital trails reflect collective intelligence and how we can use them to support efficient information seeking in software teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 2019, we have been leveraging Information Foraging Theory—a cognitive model of how humans seek information—to study how developers navigate complex environments like IDEs, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and the web. We extend this theory to understand not just individuals but entire teams, modeling how social cues and task context shape collective foraging behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work has led to the development of new theoretical frameworks, predictive models, and cognitive tools that aim to reduce the burden of information overload, improve collaboration, and support inclusive decision-making in software development. These insights are informing the next generation of intelligent developer tools for both solo and remote collaborative work.

  <p>
    The rise of remote and hybrid work has reshaped how software teams collaborate—but most platforms overlook the role of social identities like gender and race in shaping those interactions. This research investigates how these identities affect communication, task-sharing, and psychological safety in remote programming teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drawing from software engineering, HCI, and organizational psychology, our work provides both foundational theory and practical tools to support inclusive and equitable team collaboration. We aim to design systems that recognize identity-based differences and actively foster better teamwork across diverse teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our empirical studies on gender and race in remote pair programming revealed disparities in interruption patterns, task delegation, and team confidence. Additional findings showed that mixed-race teams often demonstrate strong productivity and leadership balance, while also facing higher communication anxiety. These studies were presented at ICSE and published in VL/HCC and TOSEM.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also developed one of the first equity-centered research frameworks for recruiting and supporting diverse participants in computing studies. Based on interviews with software researchers, this work addresses institutional barriers and introduces tools such as an identity-method matrix and inclusive protocol designs. Published in the ICSE SEIS track, it advances ethical standards for equity in empirical research.

        Although gender differences in a technological world receive significant research attention, much of this 
        research and practice aims at how society and education can impact the success and retention of women in 
        computer science. The possibility of gender biases within software, however, has received almost no attention. 
        A method called GenderMag is developed. GenderMag (Gender-Inclusiveness Magnifier) is an inspection method for 
        software practitioners to evaluate and create a gender-inclusive problem-solving software. Currently, we are working 
        on extending the GenderMag method to GenderMag-Collab for supporting pair-programming. We also plan on developing tool 
        to broaden the participation in computer education.

        Additionally, we are interested in characterizing brain neural response in the same and mixed genders pairs during collaboration 
        on problem-solving task. Finally, utilizing machine learning to identified the differences in brain neural responses in the same 
        and mixed gender dyads during problem solving. This research is in collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.laureateinstitute.org">Laureate

            Managers are increasingly using online contributions 
            to make hiring decisions. However, it is nontrivial to find relevant information 
            about candidates in large online, global communities. Potential employers, 
            as well as recruiters, are increasingly using the history of public contributions 
            to locate suitable candidates, filter applicants for a position, or inform 
            interview interactions.  Literature suggests that both types of information 
            (technical and social skills) are important when assessing developers. 
            We designed Visual Resume to aggregate activity traces across two different 
            types of peer production sites: a code hosting site (GitHub) and a technical 
            Q&A forum (Stack Overflow). It aggregates developer activities across projects 
            and languages to portray their technical and soft skills. More specifically, 
            it extracts histories of commits, issues, comments, programming languages, and 
            projects in GitHub. For Stack Overflow it groups data on answers, questions, 
            comments, and tags. Aggregating activities across online communities can build
            a more accurate profile, since developers can contribute to multiple projects 
            and forums. This also helps in comparison of contributions across sites as 
            different sites can have different presentation styles. Our scenario-based, 
            formative study found that participants appreciated the ability to compare 
            candidates based on overall summaries, and to drill down to a particular 
            contribution to assess its quality. (<font color="red"><b> Best Paper Award </b></font>)

            Computer-supported creative 
            tasks—such as writing, graphic design, creating presentations, and some forms of programming—
            are often exploratory in nature. People often need to build upon and compare multiple ideas, 
            fit them together and save the intermediate steps. Foraging among too many similar variants 
            of the same artifact need more cognitive effort especially for no-vice programmers. We took 
            a first step towards a theory of variation foraging through a qualitative empirical study 
            investigating how novice programmers reuse variants. Based on our findings, we developed a 
            predictive model, PFIS-V, a computational model of foraging that is able to account for 
            multiple similar variants in an information space. Our empirical results show that PFIS-V 
            is up to 25% more accurate than the previous programming computation model in predicting 
            where a forager will navigate in a variationed information space. Based on these studies 
            we found that if we account for complex information organized hierarchically we can 
            increase the accuracy of finding variants and hence developed PFIS-H computational model.

            I am using social network analysis and deep machine learning techniques to 
            understand the socio-technical 
           behavior of programmers. For example, I am investigating how people learn code between 
           their social and technical collaborations. I am also investigating the social behavior 
           of the programmers when they move within and between social and technical sites. 
           The understanding of these will help in designing tools for searching code, 
           which programmers can trust and are based on their social interactions.

        <p>
            Programmers reuse code to increase their productivity, which leads to large 
            fragments of duplicate or near-duplicate code in the code base. The current 
            code clone detection techniques for finding semantic clones utilize 
            Program Dependency Graphs (PDG), which are expensive and resource-intensive. 
            PDG and other clone detection techniques utilize code and have completely 
            ignored the comments - due to ambiguity of English language, but in terms of 
            program comprehension, comments carry the important domain knowledge. 
            utilized with LDA and are equivalent to sophisticated PDG based techniques. 
            One approach would be using comments with LDA to detect clone sets at the file 
            level, as this process is less resource-intensive, and applying PDG based code 
            detection techniques at the function level.

            We have developed a theory-based approach called 
            the “Idea Garden” that considers how end-user  (non-professionals) programmers generate 
            ideas when learning programming concepts for the first time based on Minimalist theory. 
            It uses an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving 
            strategies, and for programming patterns and concepts. We have developed a generalized 
            architecture to facilitate the inclusion of Idea Gardens into other systems. 
            The Idea Garden approach has considered how EUPs generate ideas when learning 
            programming concepts for the first time based on the diversity of EUPs' problem-solving 
            situations. Hence, the Idea Garden supports EUP environments by providing context-sensitive 
            advice, mini-patterns and problem-solving strategies that help them learn in the context 
            of their own activities. We empirically investigated our prototype in three studies: a 
            formative think-aloud study, a pair of summer camps attended by 42 teens, and a third 
            summer camp study featuring a different environment attended by 48 teens. Our results 
            showed that participants required significantly less in-person help than in a previous 
            camp to learn the same amount of material in the same amount of time. Our studies showed 
            the effectiveness of the Idea Garden's principles and support for different contexts in 
            helping EUPs solve the programming problems that get them “stuck”—across a diversity 
            of problems, information processing and problem-solving styles, cognitive stages, 
            tasks, host IDEs, programming languages, and people.

        My research has supported exploratory programming at different levels; namely, 
        workspace, file, and online-repositories. My initial research was part of the Exploratory 
        Programming project, a collaboration involving Carnegie Mellon University, 
        Oregon State University, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 
        and University of Washington. We supported <FONT COLOR="920000">AppInventorHelper

        The web is a wild content rich platform and finding mechanisms to effectively and 
        efficiently access information on it can be challenging. Creating applications 
        that optimize information access and utilize web-based distributed programming 
        involves aggregating heterogeneous web APIs distributed across different platforms. 
        Building such programs is challenging as they contain software and hardware dependencies 
        not represented in traditional programming environments.  My own analysis of a 
        large corpus (51,468) of (Yahoo! Pipes) mashup code and execution logs showed 
        that more than 64.1% of mashups contained bugs primarily caused by changes 
        in the sources' data. To provide better automatic detection of bugs, 
        I created a classification scheme 
        of bugs as Intra-module (bugs that occur within a module) and Inter-module 

        (bugs that involve interactions between modules) bugs. Based on these 
        classifications, an anomaly detector that can automatically detect bugs was implemented.</p><img src="images/lensview.png" alt="" /><img src="images/IFTModel.png" alt=""/>

        (e.g., labels on links) in patches (e.g., web pages, IDEs). 
        We contributed to the theory by creating a model that allowed us 
        to refine our understanding of the debugging behavior of EUPs by 
        separately focusing on the localization and correction of faults.
